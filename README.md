## Task 1: General Requirements
- Created an index.html file to display my information including my name, headshot, skills, and resume. Hosted this page as a personal website on my GitHub cloud account under the name `Sangeethsk01.github.io`.

  
- Created another file named course.html that introduces this course and provides the links to all the labs and hackathons I completed. Provided this file as a link in the personal website page in the 'About' section.


## Task 2: Non-technical requirements
- I have used an open-source bootstrap template and CSS library to design this portfolio. The page contains features like the animation on scroll (aos), navigation bar, reload effects, etc.

  
- Included a page tracker using `flagcounter` to count the number of visitors to the page. Included this counter at the bottom of the page.

## Task 3: Technical requirements
### Javascript frameworks
- Used jQuery to implement an analog clock in the 'more' section and a digital clock, a show/hide email function in the 'about' section.
- Used javascript open source library 'anime' library to create animation by making a button move when clicked on it. Used an EventListner to achieve this.
### API Integration
- Included the public jokeAPI to display a new joke every one minute. Used ajax function to send the API get request.
- Used a public API named `rickandmortyapi` to get cartoon characters when requested. Built a function to generate a random number to get a random character when clicked on the button.
### Using JavaScript cookies
- Using a cookie, written a Javascript code to display a welcome message for the new visitors and a welcomeback message for the old visitors on the home section. The JavaScript code includes two functions for handling cookies in the web browser. The setCookie function sets a cookie with a given name, value, and optional expiration period in days. The getCookie function retrieves the value of a specified cookie by searching through the document's stored cookies.
