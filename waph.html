<h2>About Course</h2>
This course, "Web Application Development and Security," covers front-end (HTML5, JavaScript, CSS) and back-end (PHP/MySQL) technologies. Students explore web application vulnerabilities and attacks through hands-on exercises, learning secure programming principles. The course aims to enhance skills in developing robust, secure web applications, addressing security threats, and adopting countermeasures. By focusing on practical knowledge and contemporary technologies, students gain the ability to design and implement secure web solutions.
<h3>Labs</h3>
  <h4>Lab0:</h4>
  Lab 0, covered in Lecture 2 of the course with preparation in Lecture 1, focuses on Development Environment Setup. Divided into two parts, participants deploy an Ubuntu 22.04 VM on CECH Sandbox, install software, and test the Apache Web Server. The second part involves cloning the course repository, creating a private repository on GitHub, and completing git exercises. The submission requires using Pandoc to generate a PDF report following the provided template.
  <h4>Lab1:</h4>
  In the lab, I explored two key areas: the HTTP protocol and basic web application programming. In the first part, I got hands-on experience using Wireshark to understand how data moves on the web. I also learned to communicate with servers using telnet. Moving on to the second part, I focused on creating simple web applications using the programming languages C and PHP. Throughout the process, I gained insights into how different types of requests, such as GET and POST, work in web applications. The lab was designed to be interactive, ensuring I not only understood the concepts but also had the opportunity to play with them hands-on.
  <h4>Lab2:</h4>
  In Task 1, a basic HTML page with forms and dynamic JavaScript features like date display and an analog clock was created. User input was submitted via GET and POST requests to "echo.php". In Task 2, diverse web development aspects were covered, including Ajax for asynchronous HTTP requests, CSS styling through an external file, jQuery for Ajax interactions, and web API integration for fetching jokes and estimating age using the JokeAPI and Agify API. The task emphasized network inspection for understanding request and response details. Link to lab2: https://github.com/Sangeethsk01/waph-kotagisr/tree/main/labs/lab2
<h3>Hackathons</h3>
  <h4>hackathon1:</h4>
  The WAPH (Web Application Programming and Hacking) Hackathon, comprised two main components: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attacks and Defenses. I navigated through seven levels of XSS challenges, creatively injecting scripts to display names while adhering to various security constraints. The hackathon details each level's approach, from simple script injections to challenging restrictions on specific words like 'script' or 'alert.' The Defenses section showcased enhancements to the PHP code, incorporating input validation and XSS defense mechanisms. Additionally, improvements in the Lab 2 front-end prototype included input validation, the use of innerText for secure content updates, the introduction of the encodeInput() function for XSS defense, and secure handling of APIs. The Hackathon provided a holistic learning experience, offering practical insights into web application security practices and the implementation of robust defense strategies.
